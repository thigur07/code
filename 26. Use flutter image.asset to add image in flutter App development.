steps:
1)create a "assets" folder insde that create another "images" folder (assets/images) in root project folder and paste the image inside that folder.

2)edit "pubspec.yaml" file whcih is avaible in root folder  of project.
search for following code inside this file:
# To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  # assets:
  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

now repalce this code with following code:
# To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
     - assets/images/famtitlab.jpg

3)Note- replace the "famtitlab.jpg" file name with your image file name.(in both main.dart and pubspec.yaml file)


4) paste the following code in main.dart file:

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() => runApp(MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
// This widget is the root
// of your application

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Insert Image Demo'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            children: <Widget>[
              Image.asset('assets/images/famtitlab.jpg'),
